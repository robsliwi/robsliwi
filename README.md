## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Robert

Currently struggling with maintaining state of a few hundreds hosts around the globe at daytime job.
Freelancing and tinkering with instances and systems I've jumped on the NixOS hype train, tooot, tooot ðŸš‚

Besides that I had some exposure to networking, mailservers, virtualisation, data storage, and various other things.

Had contributed to some Rails apps (b2c and b2b), some APIs in Go and some drive-by-commits to open source projects I stumble across from time to time.
